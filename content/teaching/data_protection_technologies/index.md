The course focuses on technologies that can be used to protect data from unauthorized access. The main motivation is to protect personal data and comply with data protection legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union. The course
* explains the context of data protection technologies from multiple angles (e.g., legal requirements, interplay with other quality attributes);
* conveys in-depth knowledge on some specific data protection technologies (e.g., cryptographic protocols for secure multi-party computation, anonymization and pseudonymization, differential privacy, access control, anonymous communications);
* showcases applications of data protection technologies (in particular, privacy-preserving machine learning and location privacy).

The course is closely linked to the research performed by CCI researchers in the field of security and privacy (for example, in the [SECURED](/project/secured/), [FogProtect](/project/fogprotect), and [EPI](/project/epi) projects).
