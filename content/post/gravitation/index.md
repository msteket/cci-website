The project **Challenges in Cyber Security** is a cooperation of five Dutch institutions (CWI, RU, TU/e, UvA, and VU) with the aim of making fundamental contributions to security research.
It is one of the seven projects in the Netherlands to receive an *NWO Gravitation grant* this year, providing altogether 21.5 million euro funding over the next 10 years.
The UvA team is led by [Christian Schaffner](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/c.schaffner/) and includes CCI researchers [Karst Koymans](https://cci-research.nl/author/karst-koymans/), [Kostas Papagiannopoulos](https://cci-research.nl/author/kostas-papagiannopoulos/), [Zoltan Mann](https://cci-research.nl/author/zoltan-mann/), and [Francesco Regazzoni](https://cci-research.nl/author/francesco-regazzoni/).
