The project **LICORICE (reLIable and sCalable tOols foR self-sovereIgn identity and data proteCtion framEwork)** is a pan-European cooperation of research and industry players, focusing on developing the next generation of tools and technologies for identity management and data protection.
LICORICE will receive funding of 4 million EUR for 3 years from the European Union, as an innovation action in the Horizon Europe research program.
Within the project, UvA - including CCI researchers [Kanwal Batool](https://cci-research.nl/author/kanwal-batool/) and [Zoltan Mann](https://cci-research.nl/author/zoltan-mann/) - will mainly focus on privacy-preserving neural network inference.
