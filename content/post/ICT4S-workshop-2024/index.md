At the 10th [International Conference on ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ict4s-2024), Ana and Pepijn organise a [workshop on Sustainable Privacy Enhancing Techniques](https://ict4s2024-suspets.github.io/workshop/). The workshop delves into two critical aspects of PETs, namely: energy consumption and data utility. With ICT's substantial carbon footprint and growing privacy concerns, this workshop aims to bridge the gap between research and informed decision-making. The workshop host presentations addressing these concerns, allowing discussion of the outcomes in a group of peers.

This workshop is part of the interdisciplinary research on the theme of Responsible Digital Transformation for the project on ["Sustainable privacy-enhanced data"](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/about-the-university/strategy/theme-based-collaboration/responsible-digital-transformations.html#Sustainable-privacyenhanced-data).
